# NextBusFinder
API Consumption Case Study for technical interview

Instuctions:
-Go to https://oliverokeefe.github.io/NextBusFinder/.
-Enter a route in the Route field.
-Enter a direction in the Direction field.
-Enter a stop in the Stop field.
-Fix any invalid input.
-Click the button that says "Find Next Bus".

Notes:
-Validation on direction requires a valid route to be entered.
-Validation on stop requires both a valid route and direction.
-There are routes listed at the bottom. Stops will be listed one both a valid route and direction are entered.
-If there are no more busses for the day (the API did not return any, or Metro Transit returned something wierd), the program will tell you.
-If the bus is "Due" then the program says the bus is "0 minutes" away.
